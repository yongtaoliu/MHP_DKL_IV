# MHP_DKL_IV

This Repository includes the code for our paper about DKL-IV exploration in metal halide perovskite. The notebook shows the code running in a GPU server for DKL training after receiving real-time data from scanning probe microscopy and subsequently sends next measurement location to scanning probe microscopy.
